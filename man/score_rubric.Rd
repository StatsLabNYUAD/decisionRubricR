\title{Score a set of probabilistic predictions with the teaching rubric}
\usage{
score_rubric(truth, prob, tau = 0.3, n_bins = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{Integer/binary vector (0/1) of true outcomes.}

\item{prob}{Numeric vector of predicted probabilities in \link{0,1}.}

\item{tau}{Decision threshold (default 0.30).}

\item{n_bins}{Number of quantile bins for calibration slope (default 10).}
}
\value{
A named list with the five component scores and the composite.
}
\description{
Computes five components (calibration slope proximity to 1, AUC,
rescaled MCC, Brier Skill Score, and decision-curve Net Benefit)
and a weighted composite.
