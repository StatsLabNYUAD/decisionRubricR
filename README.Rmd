## Overview

decisionRubricR is an R package for evaluating the quality of human–AI decision making and predictive models using a composite rubric. Instead of focusing only on accuracy, the package combines five complementary metrics: calibration slope, area under the ROC curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), Brier skill score (BSS), and decision-curve net benefit (NB). These are fused into a single composite score, making evaluation more reliable and educationally useful. The package also includes helper functions for reliability analysis (Cronbach’s alpha) and skill correlation, making it useful for both teaching and applied AI evaluation.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# Install remotes if not already available
